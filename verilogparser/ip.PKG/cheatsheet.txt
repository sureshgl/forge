Running make in this dir, runs some sanity checks on verilog and json
files and prepares RTL for release to customers.

Running make in this dir does the following things:
 1. Maps RTL parameters and reports any issues
 2. Checks for duplicate module definitions
 3. Process all docs.json and scripts.json files
 4. For required vendor and tech, copies over 
    in to <tot>/ip_obfuscated dir:
     a. obfuscated verilog
     b. testbench files
     c. docs
     d. scripts
    in to <tot>/ip_encrypted dir:
     a. encrypted verilog
     b. testbench files
     c. docs
     d. scripts

If everything look good, 'all good' is reported at the end and script
exits cleanly.

Examples:
For all vendor and all tech:
  make all_all

For arm tsmc40g, run
  make arm_tsmc40g

After running make, check the output directories and their contents.
