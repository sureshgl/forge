In order to enable flop stages within DFT wrapper, flopcmd and flopmem should be used.

If two flop stages need to be added at the input of the memory within DFT wrapper, and
one output flop stage then the following '-flop' should be enabled.

memogen -a 2Ror1W -b 64 -w 1024 -f 300
    -flop flopcmd=2:flopmem=1 -name marvell_2ror1w_1024x64

If zero flop stages need to be added at the input of the memory within DFT wrapper, and
two output flop stage then the following command line options should be enabled.

memogen -a 2Ror1W -b 64 -w 1024 -f 300 -ecc parity
    -flop flopmem=2 -name marvell_2ror1w_1024x64

Note:
-----
flopin, flopecc, and flopout add flop stages within the algorithm logic and not in DFT
logic.
